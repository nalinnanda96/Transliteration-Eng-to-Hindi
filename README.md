# Transliteration-Eng-to-Hindi
A transliteration model from English to Hindi using LSTMs

The task of machine transliteration involves mapping the representation of a 
word to another language, typically using a different alphabet, based on its
sound or spelling, rather than its meaning. Transliteration is commonly applied
to proper names, as well as to terms in rapidly growing areas, such as medicine
or technology. Two principal applications for machine transliteration are
machine translation and information searchâ€”multilingual information retrieval
(IR), information extraction (IE), and named-entity recognition (NER).

This project aims to transliterate for the pair of languages i.e. English to Hindi. It uses a Long Short Term Memory Units(LSTMs) 
with fixed delays and one hot encoding to achieve this process.

The dataset taken is the FIRE Dataset (IIT KGP). A new dataset was also generated using English transliterated lyrics of Hindi songs using web scraping.
